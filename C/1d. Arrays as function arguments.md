# How to get the number of elements in an array

One way to get the size of an array is to use the `sizeof` function.

```c
int A[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int size = sizeof(A)/sizeof(A[0]);
```

This takes the total size of the array and divides it by the size of one element. Therefore, the calculated value is equivalent to the number of elements in the array.

However, when we pass an array as a function argument *by value*, (not by reference), then under the hood, the compiler creates a pointer to the same type as the input array, to the first element, and uses that as the value.

The key thing to understand here is that you don't get a copy of your array in the function you've called, even if you have passed the array by value.

This is called 'reference parameters'. Arrays are always passed by reference. This is because arrays can be very large in size, so this eliminates the need to duplicate the array values in memory when passing by value.

So, in this sample code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void Double(int* A, int size) // A can also be `int[] A` here. it means the same thing.
{
  int i, sum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
  {
    A[i] = 2 * A[i];
  }
}

int main()
{
  int A[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
  int size = sizeof(A) / sizeof(A[0]);
  int i;
  Double(A, size);
  for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
  {
    printf("%d ", A[i]);
  }
}
```

`Double` would actually work - it would actually modify the `A` array, even though we've technically passed it by value, because it is taking it by reference. The compiler implicitly dereferences for us.
