# Multi-dimensional arrays

A 3D array can be considered as an array of '2D arrays'. It works similarly to before, so assuming we have a 3D array `C`, accessing `C[3][2][2]` will return a pointer to the element at the 4th element of the first array, the 3rd element of the 2nd array, and the 3rd element of the 3rd array.
