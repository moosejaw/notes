# Pointers and arrays

We can declare an integer array like this:

```c
int A[5];
```

This tells the program we want an array of `int`s with 5 slots.

So, we know that an `int` is generally 4 bytes, so this statement will assign `5 * 4` bytes to `A` in memory.

The memory locations in arrays are contiguous. So we can actually use pointer arithmetic to traverse an array:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int A[5] = { 5, 2, 4, 5, 6 };
  int *p;

  p = &A[0]; // store the address of the first element in the pointer

  printf("element 1 : %d\n", *p);

  p = p + 1;

  printf("element 2 : %d\n", *p);

}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that incrementing a pointer like this will increment a pointer **by the size of the underlying data structure**, so the pointer moves to the next contiguous location in memory. However, this can be dangerous, if the memory location accessed is not initialised.

In our case, it may be problematic if we change `p` to reference element 6 in the array, which is unassigned, because the array only has 5 slots:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int A[5] = { 5, 2, 4, 5, 6 };
  int *p;

  p = &A[0]; // store the address of the first element in the pointer

  printf("element 1 : %d\n", *p);

  p = p + 5; // p ~= A[5], which doesn't exist!
  printf("element 6 : %d\n", *p);
}
```
